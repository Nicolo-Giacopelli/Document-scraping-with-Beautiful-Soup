# Document-scraping-with-Beautiful-Soup

This was one of the small projects done with Foxintelligence, a French consumer intelligence SaaS platform that held a course during the Master program. We were given a large folder of online receipts in .html format, from which a series of specific information needed to be parsed in the least amount of time possible. The Beautiful Soup library has been used and the code proved to greatly exceed the standards of efficiency. The repo comprises the parsing functions and an example of .html receipt.
